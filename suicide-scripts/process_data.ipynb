with oxygenation despite cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q 4h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q 1h due to the fact that she continued to have labored

impaired gas exchange impaired endurance impaired ventilation and needed help with supine to sit however she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour on motor exam her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were at the knee at the ankle at the elbows and hips it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as
